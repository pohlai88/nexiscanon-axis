# AXIS Plans — Entry Point (SSOT)

Start here:

➡️ **`A-canonical-can/CAN000-CANON-MAP.md`**

---

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Only `CAN*` docs are authoritative.**
2. If two docs conflict, **CAN wins**.
3. `SUP*` = context only. `EVI*` = evidence only. `ARC*` = do not use.
4. No “complete” claims without proof outputs.

---

## Folder Meaning

- `A-canonical-can/` — **CANONICAL (SSOT)**
- `B-supporrting-sup/` — **SUPPORTING**
- `C-evidence-evi/` — **EVIDENCE**
- `z-archive-arc/` — **ARCHIVED**
