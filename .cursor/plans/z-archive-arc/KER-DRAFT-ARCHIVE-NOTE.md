# Archive Note: KER-DRAFT.md

**Archived:** 2026-01-20  
**Reason:** Superseded by restructured documentation

## Replacement Documents

The content from `KER-DRAFT.md` has been restructured into:

1. **KER000-KERNEL-CONSTITUTION.md** — Constitutional principles, laws, and glossary
2. **KER001-KERNEL-CAPABILITY-MAP-v1.3.md** — Complete capability taxonomy and EVI matrix
3. **KER-IMPLEMENTATION-CROSSWALK.md** — Spec-to-code mapping and implementation status

## What Was Preserved

✅ All capability definitions (K-M4, K-M5, K-M6, K-M7, K-M10, K-M11, K-M13)  
✅ All EVI specifications (EVI041-EVI059)  
✅ Core primitive type definitions  
✅ Manifest contract structure  
✅ Kernel guarantee statements  
✅ Post-v1.3 follow-after roadmap

## What Was Enhanced

- Added actual codebase implementation patterns
- Enriched with real code examples from packages
- Added proper markdown formatting
- Created comprehensive crosswalk to actual code
- Added implementation status tracking

## Original File
