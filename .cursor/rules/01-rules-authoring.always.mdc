# Cursor Rules Authoring Law (Always Apply)

## Purpose
Prevent spaghetti rules, duplication, contradictions, and bloat.

## Required Architecture
- Exactly ONE global shared rule file:
  - `.cursor/rules/00-global.always.mdc`
- All other rules MUST be delta-only and scoped by globs.

## Delta-Only Rule Standard
Every non-global rule MUST start with:
> Applies on top of `00-global.always.mdc`. Do NOT restate global rules.

## Naming Convention (Mandatory)
`{domain}.{topic}.delta.mdc`

Examples:
- `app.docs.delta.mdc`
- `api.auth.delta.mdc`
- `shared.utils.delta.mdc`

## Duplication Ban (Hard Rule)
- Never copy/paste rule text across rule files.
- Shared text belongs ONLY in `00-global.always.mdc`.

## No Bypass Rule
If you later introduce `AGENTS.md` (anywhere under `.cursor/` or the repo),
it MUST follow the same Global + Delta structure:
- shared rules belong ONLY in `00-global.always.mdc`
- scoped guidance belongs in delta-only rule files

## Enforcement (HARD RULE)
**MANDATORY**: Duplication is enforced by CI via `jscpd` on `.cursor/rules/**/*.{mdc,md}`.

**REQUIRED**: Before creating or modifying any rule file:
1. Check for existing similar rules in `00-global.always.mdc`
2. If content exists globally → DO NOT duplicate, reference it instead
3. If content is new → determine if it belongs in global or delta
4. If shared across 2+ domains → MUST go in `00-global.always.mdc`

**FORBIDDEN**:
- ❌ Copy/pasting rule text across rule files
- ❌ Restating global rules in delta files
- ❌ Creating duplicate content in multiple delta files

**VERIFICATION**: Any duplication must be removed by merging shared content into `00-global.always.mdc`.
