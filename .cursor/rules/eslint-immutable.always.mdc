# ESLint Configuration Immutability Rule (Always Apply)

> Applies on top of `00-global.always.mdc`. Do NOT restate global rules.

## Purpose
Protect ESLint configuration from accidental or unauthorized modifications.

## Protected Files (HARD BAN - NO EXCEPTIONS)

The following files are **IMMUTABLE** and MUST NOT be modified by the IDE/agent:

```
eslint.config.mjs                          # Root config (single source of truth)
apps/*/eslint.config.js                    # App configs (extend root only)
packages/*/eslint.config.js                # Package configs (extend root only)
.eslintignore                              # If exists
```

## Prohibited Actions (HARD ENFORCEMENT)

**FORBIDDEN** (without explicit user approval AND justification):
- ❌ Creating new ESLint config files
- ❌ Modifying existing ESLint config files
- ❌ Deleting ESLint config files
- ❌ Adding ESLint-related dependencies
- ❌ Changing ESLint rules in any file
- ❌ Adding inline `eslint-disable` comments (except for documented exceptions)

## Allowed Actions

**PERMITTED**:
- ✅ Running `pnpm lint` to check for errors
- ✅ Reporting lint errors to the user
- ✅ Suggesting rule changes (but NOT implementing them)

## Exception Protocol

If a user explicitly requests ESLint config changes:

1. **STOP** and confirm the request
2. State: "ESLint config is protected. You've requested: [specific change]"
3. Ask: "This will modify immutable config. Confirm? (yes/no)"
4. Only proceed if user confirms with explicit "yes"
5. Document the change in commit message

## Rationale

- ESLint config follows shadcn/ui's single-source-of-truth pattern
- All apps extend root config to ensure consistency
- Prevents accidental rule fragmentation across packages
- Enforced by git pre-commit hook as additional safeguard
